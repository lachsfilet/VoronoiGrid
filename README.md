# VoronoiGrid
Library for grid based Voronoi diagram generation.

This library generates two dimensional region maps, based on Vornoi diagram generation using Fortunes Sweepline algorithm.

Thanks to Mark de Berg, Otfried Cheong, Marc van Krefeld and Mark Overmars, their book Computational Geometry allowed me
to understand the structure and process of that algorithm.
